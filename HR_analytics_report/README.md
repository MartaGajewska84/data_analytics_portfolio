# üìä HR Analytics Report (Power BI)

## üß≠ Overview
This project presents an **HR Analytics Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, designed to demonstrate skills in **data modeling**, **data transformation**, and **interactive reporting**.  
The report provides a clear overview of the company‚Äôs workforce structure, demographics, and attrition trends, supporting data-driven HR decision-making.

> üß™ **Note:** The dataset used in this project is **artificial** and was created solely for the purpose of demonstrating report creation and analytical modeling skills.  
> It does **not** include any real or confidential employee information.

## üéØ Project Motivation
The goal of this project was to create a **complete end-to-end Power BI report** that showcases:
- Proficiency in designing an analytical **data model** (star schema).  
- Competence in using **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation.  
- Ability to build **interactive dashboards** that deliver clear, actionable insights.  

This HR-themed dataset was chosen because it provides meaningful metrics‚Äîsuch as headcount, attrition, and demographics‚Äîthat reflect real-world HR analysis scenarios while remaining synthetic and safe for public sharing.

## üß† Data Model Design

The model is built using a **star schema** for performance and clarity.  
At its center is the **`people_fact`** table, connected to several dimension tables describing employees‚Äô demographics, departments, job levels, and employment details.

### üî∏ Fact Table
- **`people_fact`** ‚Äì Core dataset containing employee records, hire dates, employment status, and foreign keys linking to dimension tables.

### üîπ Dimension Tables

| Table | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `demographic_dim` | Employee demographics such as age, gender, and race. |
| `education_dim` | Highest level of education achieved. |
| `location_dim` | Office or regional location information. |
| `department_dim` | Department and sub-department structure. |
| `job_level_dim` | Job levels or grades within the company. |
| `manager_dim` | Manager hierarchy up to four levels. |
| `marital_dim` | Marital status of employees. |
| `term_dim` | Termination types and reasons, used for attrition analysis. |

This structure enables flexible analysis of workforce composition and trends ‚Äî such as **headcount by department**, **attrition by reason**, or **gender distribution across locations**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Modeling Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Imported raw data from `.csv` and `.xlsx` sources into Power BI.  
- Cleaned and formatted fields using **Power Query**, including renaming columns, fixing data types, and standardizing categorical values.  
- Added surrogate keys to define consistent relationships between tables.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Model Development
- Established one-to-many relationships between the `people_fact` table and dimension tables.  
- Implemented a **star schema** for optimized analytical performance.  
- Marked the `Dates` table as a **Date Table** to enable time-intelligence calculations.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ DAX Measures
Developed DAX calculations for key HR metrics, including:
- **Headcount** ‚Äì Total number of active employees.  
- **Attrition Rate** ‚Äì Percentage of employees who have left the company within a given period.  
- **Employee Status Breakdown** ‚Äì Active vs. terminated employees.  
- **Headcount by Department / Location / Education Level.**
